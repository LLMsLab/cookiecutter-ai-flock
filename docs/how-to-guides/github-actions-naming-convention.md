# Enforcing Naming Conventions Using GitHub Actions

!!! note "Overview"
    Enforcing consistent naming conventions in machine learning projects is crucial for organization and clarity. GitHub Actions provides a seamless solution to automate naming convention checks in your GitHub repositories.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setup GitHub Actions for Naming Convention Checks

1. **Creating the Workflow File**:
   - Place a YAML file named `check_naming_convention.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
   - Define triggers for the workflow (e.g., on push and pull requests) and the script to execute.

2. **Writing the Validation Script**:
   - Add a Python script `validate_naming.py` to `.github/scripts/`.
   - The script should contain functions to validate naming conventions using regular expressions.

3. **Executing the Workflow**:
   - The workflow runs on each push or pull request, executing the Python script.
   - It checks file and branch names, failing if naming conventions are violated.

!!! example "Example Workflow File"
    ```yaml
    name: Check Naming Convention

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      naming-convention-check:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Validate Naming Convention
          run: python .github/scripts/validate_naming.py
          env:
            GITHUB_REF: ${{ github.ref }}
    ```

!!! example "Example Python Script Structure"
    ```python
    """
    This module `validate_naming.py` is part of a GitHub Actions workflow
    designed to enforce naming conventions across various assets in a
    machine learning project. It includes functions to validate the naming
    of Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, model persistence files, data
    files, and Git branches.
    
    The module contains the following key functions: -
    `validate_ml_file_naming`: Checks naming conventions for Jupyter
    notebooks and Python scripts.  - `validate_model_file_naming`: Ensures
    model file names adhere to the specified naming standards.  -
    `validate_data_file_naming`: Validates data file names against the
    project's naming conventions.  - `validate_git_branch_naming`: Checks if
    the Git branch names follow the predefined naming patterns.
    
    The script is executed as part of a GitHub Actions workflow and is
    essential for maintaining consistency, readability, and organization of
    files in the repository.
    
    Note: - This script is meant to be run as a GitHub Action and relies on
    environmental variables provided by GitHub workflows.  - Regular
    expressions are used for pattern matching to validate the naming
    conventions.
