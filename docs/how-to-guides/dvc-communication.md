# How-To Guide: Communication of Data Version in a Collaborative Setting

## Introduction

!!! note "Goal of This Guide"
    Master the art of communicating data version changes effectively in collaborative projects using Data Version Control (DVC) and GitHub. This guide is crucial for teams striving for clarity and consistency in their data-driven projects.

### Prerequisites

- :octicons-checklist-16: Familiarity with DVC and GitHub.
- :octicons-tools-16: DVC and Git installed and set up in your project.

## Effective Data Version Communication Steps

### 1. Clear Commit Messages and Pull Requests

!!! tip "Commit Messages"
    - Be descriptive with your commit messages when including DVC-tracked files.
    - Example: "Update dataset.csv to version 2.1 for model training."

!!! info "Pull Requests (PRs)"
    - PR descriptions should clearly state data changes and their purposes.
    - This clarity aids team members in understanding the update's context.

### 2. Using DVC Files in Git

- :octicons-file-code-24: DVC tracks changes using `.dvc` files, committed to Git.
- :octicons-eye-16: Team members can view these files in commits or PRs on GitHub to identify data versions.

### 3. Syncing Data with DVC Pull

- After updates, run `dvc pull` to synchronize local data with the tracked branch version.
  
  ```bash
  dvc pull
  ```

### 4. Automated Notifications on GitHub

- :octicons-bell-16: Utilize GitHub's notification features for real-time update alerts.
- :octicons-watch-16: Watching a repository can also keep the team informed.

### 5. Keeping Project Documentation Updated

- :octicons-book-24: Maintain a section in your project's documentation or README about current data versions.
- :octicons-pencil-16: Update this section following any significant dataset changes.

### 6. Regular Communication Channels

- :octicons-comment-discussion-24: Hold regular team meetings or send updates through emails or chat channels.
- :octicons-megaphone-16: Summarize key project changes, focusing on data and model updates.
