# GitHub Repository Naming Conventions for Data Science Projects

!!! info "Overview"
    Choosing the right naming convention for GitHub repositories in data science projects is crucial for clarity, organization, and ease of navigation. A well-defined naming convention helps team members and stakeholders to quickly understand the scope and purpose of a repository at a glance. This section outlines the guidelines for naming GitHub repositories related to data science projects.

!!! tip "Naming Convention Structure"
    Repositories should be named following this format:

    ```text
    <prefix>-<descriptive-name>[-<optional-version>]
    ```

    ???+ note "Components"
        - **Prefix**: A concise identifier related to the project's domain or main technology.
        - **Descriptive Name**: A clear and specific description of the repository's content or purpose.
        - **Optional Version**: A version number, if applicable, to distinguish between different iterations or stages of the project.

!!! check "Guidelines"
    1. **Choose an Appropriate Prefix**
       - The prefix should represent the key area or technology of the project, like `ml` for machine learning, `nlp` for natural language processing, `cv` for computer vision, etc.
       - This helps in categorizing and quickly identifying the project's domain.

    2. **Be Clear and Specific**
       - Use descriptive and meaningful terms that accurately reflect the primary focus or functionality of the repository.
       - Avoid vague or overly broad terms that do not convey the specific purpose of the repository.

    3. **Include Versioning Where Necessary**
       - For projects that have multiple versions or stages, include a version number at the end of the repository name.
       - This is useful for tracking development progress and differentiating between major project phases.

    4. **Maintain Consistency**
       - Keep all repository names in lowercase and use hyphens (`-`) to separate words. This enhances readability and avoids issues with URL encoding.

!!! example "Examples"
    - `ml-predictive-modeling`
    - `nlp-chatbot-interface`
    - `cv-facial-recognition-v1`
    - `ds-data-cleaning-tools`

!!! summary "Conclusion"
    Adopting these naming conventions for GitHub repositories in data science projects promotes a structured and systematic approach to repository management. It ensures that the repository names are informative, organized, and aligned with the project's objectives and technical domain.
