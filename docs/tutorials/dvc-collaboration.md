# Tutorial: Workflow for Collaborative Data Updates Using DVC and GitHub

## Introduction

!!! note "Learning Objectives"
    Master the workflow for managing collaborative data updates in projects using Data Version Control (DVC) and GitHub. This tutorial is designed to provide a clear guide for teams to maintain consistency and synchronization in their data-driven projects.

### Prerequisites

- :octicons-checklist-16: Basic knowledge of DVC and GitHub.
- :octicons-repo-16: A project set up with DVC and connected to a GitHub repository.

## Collaborative Update Scenario

Imagine a collaborative environment where dataset updates need to be synchronized across a team's local environments.

### Step-by-Step Workflow Guide

#### 1. Local Data Update

!!! tip "Updating Data Locally"
    - **Action**: Make changes to your dataset locally, such as adding or editing data.

#### 2. Tracking Changes with DVC

!!! success "Using DVC for Tracking"
    - **Command**: Run `dvc add <file_or_directory>` to track changes.
      ```bash
      dvc add data/dataset.csv
      ```
    - **Result**: The `.dvc` file is updated to reflect the new dataset state.

#### 3. Committing and Pushing to GitHub

!!! info "Syncing with GitHub"
    - **Commit and Push**: Update your Git repository with the new data version.
      ```bash
      git add data/dataset.csv.dvc
      git commit -m "Update dataset.csv with new data"
      git push
      ```
    - **Outcome**: Changes are now in the GitHub repository.

#### 4. Team Syncing Process

!!! warning "Team Members' Actions"
    - **Git Pull**: Team members pull the latest changes.
      ```bash
      git pull
      ```
    - **DVC Pull**: Synchronize the local data with the updated version in DVC remote storage.
      ```bash
      dvc pull
      ```
    - **Consistency Achieved**: Everyone works with the same data version.

### Sync Mechanism Explained

- :octicons-cloud-upload-24: **DVC Remote Storage**: Stores the updated data, accessible to all team members.
- :octicons-sync-16: **Local Data Sync**: `dvc pull` ensures local data matches the remote version.

### Ensuring Data Consistency

- :octicons-verified-16: **Version Control with `.dvc` Files**: Crucial for indicating the current data version.
- :octicons-git-merge-16: **Data Synchronization**: Managed through DVC commands, while Git handles `.dvc` file version control.

## Conclusion
