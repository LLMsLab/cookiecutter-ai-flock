# Using Markdown for Machine Learning Model Documentation

!!! note "Using Markdown files for Model Documentation"
    This tutorial covers the process of documenting machine learning models using Markdown. It demonstrates how to create a comprehensive and readable documentation file, covering aspects like model training, parameters, and metadata.

## Overview
- Markdown provides a simple yet effective way to document machine learning models and their metadata.
- This tutorial uses the example of a linear regression model trained on the Boston housing dataset.

## Creating Your Markdown Documentation

### Step 1: Document Overview
Start with an overview of what your model does and the dataset used.
```markdown
# Linear Regression Model Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the process of training a Linear Regression model using the Boston housing dataset. It details the generation of a metadata file capturing essential information about the model parameters, performance metrics, and data characteristics.
```

### Step 2: Model Training Description
Describe how the model is trained, including dataset details and model parameters.
```markdown
## Model Training
The model is trained using the Boston housing dataset from Scikit-Learn. We perform a basic train-test split, train a Linear Regression model using the training data, and then evaluate its performance on the test data.

### Data
- **Dataset Used**: Boston Housing Dataset
- **Features**: CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT
- **Target**: Housing Price
```

### Step 3: Detailing Model Parameters
List the parameters used in the model training.
```markdown
## Model Parameters
The model is trained with the following parameters:
- **fit_intercept**: true
- **normalize**: false
- **copy_X**: true
- **n_jobs**: null

These parameters are the default settings for Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression model.
```

### Step 4: Performance Metrics
Explain the performance metrics used to evaluate the model.
```markdown
## Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (R2)**

The values for these metrics are computed based on the model's predictions on the test set.
```

### Step 5: Metadata File Description
Describe the metadata file generated along with the model.
```markdown
## Metadata File
Alongside the model, a metadata file (`service_sage_v1.2.0_linearReg_20240123_metadata.json`) is generated. This JSON file includes:
- **Model Name**: Linear Regression
- **Timestamp**: Date when the model is trained and metadata is generated.
- **Model Parameters**: A list of parameters used to train the model.
- **Performance Metrics**: MSE and R2 values calculated from the test set.
- **Data Description**: Brief description of the dataset used.
- **Feature Names**: List of feature names from the dataset.
- **Target Name**: Name of the target variable.
```

### Step 6: File Generation Process
Conclude with details about how the model and metadata files are generated.
```markdown
## File Generation
The model is saved as a pickle file (`service_sage_v1.2.0_linearReg_20240123.pkl`), and the metadata is stored in a JSON file (`service_sage_v1.2.0_linearReg_20240123_metadata.json`). These files provide a snapshot of the model at the time of training, along with relevant information about its performance and configuration.
```

## Conclusion
This Markdown file offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of the model training and metadata generation process, suitable for inclusion in project documentation or a repository readme.
