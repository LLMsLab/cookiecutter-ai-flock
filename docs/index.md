# Cookiecutter RAG Docs

This project is designed to make it easy and effective for CDSAi members
to produce reproducible and collaborative data science software
products. Special attention was paid to:

- Supporting collaborative and reproducible best practices by automating
  the creation of easy-to-read, maintain, extend, and deploy Python
  code.
- Producing easy to write documentation in Markdown and creating a
  professional static site in minutes using GitHub Pages.
- Using GitHub in the context of Data Science projects that are cyclical and
  experimental in nature.

!!! info
    The project supports Data Science projects developed with
    Python, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Git,
    GitHub, and Data Hub servers. R or/and Domino-based projects are not
    covered in this guide.
